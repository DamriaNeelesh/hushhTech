- Use Next/Image for optimized image loading with proper width/height attributes
- Implement proper loading states and error boundaries
- Use Next/Link for client-side navigation between pages
- Implement proper SEO metadata in each page component
- Use dynamic imports for heavy components to improve initial load time
- Implement proper canonical URLs for all pages
- Use Next.js built-in font optimization
- Make sure the images should also be properly optimized and along with the nextjs image optimization
- Implement proper OpenGraph tags for social sharing
