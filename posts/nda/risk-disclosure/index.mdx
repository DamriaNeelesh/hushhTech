# Risk Disclosures

The following is a comprehensive risk disclosure statement for the Alpha Aloha Fund, designed to provide complete transparency to investors. These disclosures address market, operational, and strategy-specific risks, in alignment with SEC recommendations and the fund’s commitment to investor education and trust.

## 1. Market Risks

### 1.1 Equity Market Risk

**Description:** The fund is heavily concentrated in equities of free cash flow (FCF)-rich businesses such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Market downturns, economic crises, or company-specific issues could significantly impact the portfolio.

**Mitigation:** The fund employs options strategies to generate income and offset market declines, but this does not eliminate exposure to equity risk.

### 1.2 Volatility Risk

**Description:** Options premiums are sensitive to changes in implied volatility. A sudden reduction in volatility could reduce income generation potential, while spikes in volatility could increase losses on written options.

**Mitigation:** The fund uses historical volatility modeling and dynamic hedging to manage volatility risk.

### 1.3 Interest Rate Risk

**Description:** Rising interest rates can increase discount rates, negatively impacting the valuation of high-growth companies. This could affect core positions like technology stocks.

**Mitigation:** The fund actively monitors macroeconomic trends and adapts the portfolio to include more defensive positions when necessary.

### 1.4 Currency Risk

**Description:** Although primarily focused on U.S.-listed equities, some underlying companies have significant international exposure, introducing currency risk.

**Mitigation:** Currency risks are inherent but monitored as part of the macroeconomic analysis.

---

## 2. Concentration Risks

### 2.1 Limited Diversification

**Description:** The fund’s strategy focuses on a small number of high-quality businesses. This concentrated approach increases dependency on a few companies’ performance.

**Mitigation:** While this increases potential returns, it also amplifies risks. Investors should have a high risk tolerance and long-term horizon.

### 2.2 Sector-Specific Risk

**Description:** The portfolio is heavily weighted toward technology and consumer discretionary sectors, making it susceptible to sector-wide downturns.

**Mitigation:** The fund plans periodic sector reviews and may diversify into other sectors if opportunities arise.

---

## 3. Liquidity Risks

### 3.1 Margin and Collateral Requirements

**Description:** The use of cash-secured puts and margin for covered calls can lead to liquidity pressures, particularly during sharp market declines or margin calls.

**Mitigation:** The fund maintains a liquidity reserve of 20–25% of NAV to meet collateral needs and seize market opportunities.

### 3.2 Options Market Liquidity

**Description:** Illiquid options markets may lead to unfavorable pricing or execution delays, especially during periods of high volatility.

**Mitigation:** The fund only trades options on highly liquid equities with robust market depth.

---

## 4. Strategy-Specific Risks

### 4.1 Options Strategy Risks

**Covered Calls:** The upside is capped if the stock price rises significantly beyond the call strike.

**Mitigation:** Strike prices are carefully chosen to balance premium income with potential upside.

**Cash-Secured Puts:** The fund could be forced to buy the underlying stock at a higher-than-market price if the stock price drops significantly.

**Mitigation:** Strike prices are set below intrinsic valuation to ensure favorable entry points.

### 4.2 Short Options Exposure

**Description:** Writing options exposes the fund to potentially unlimited losses if the market moves against the positions.

**Mitigation:** All written options are fully collateralized, and stop-loss thresholds are pre-defined.
