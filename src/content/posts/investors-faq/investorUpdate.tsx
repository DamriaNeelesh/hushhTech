          Performance Recap
        </Text>
        <Text>
          The past year has been a testament to Hushh’s high-conviction strategy and disciplined execution. We delivered strong double-digit returns, significantly outperforming major indices. Our portfolio’s net gain exceeded +80% (net of fees) over the last 12 months, compared to a roughly +25% return for the S&P 500. Key wins included large positions in the AI and semiconductor space that surged, as well as timely energy trades capitalizing on commodity price trends. We navigated volatile markets – from interest rate spikes to geopolitical tremors – with resilient performance and minimal drawdowns. Notably, we closed over 90% of our trades at a profit, with an average gain of ~12% on winners versus a 2% loss on losers. This 93.7% win rate reflects strict risk management: we cut losses quickly and let our high-conviction ideas run. Our +9.4% single-day gain on February 28, 2025 exemplifies the agility and precision of our approach, turning market momentum into tangible profits. Such results underscore Hushh’s ability to generate sustainable alpha in diverse conditions – a feat achieved by very few.

          Figure: Hushh’s trading performance metrics over the past year. We achieved an average +11.8% gain on winning trades versus -1.7% on losing trades, across 332 trades (311 gains, 21 losses). This translates to a 93.7% success rate – a result of our disciplined strategy and AI-driven decision-making.

        Investment Strategy & Philosophy
      </Heading>
      <VStack align="start" spacing={4}>
        <Text>
        Hushh Investments’ strategy centers on one core aim: generating sustainable alpha through advanced technology, deep research, and sound economics. We leverage advanced mathematics, AI, and statistics to spot opportunities that others miss. Our proprietary AI-driven models sift through millions of data points – financial statements, price patterns, macro indicators – to identify mispricings and momentum in a dynamic market. This quant prowess is fused with fundamental analysis and seasoned judgment. In practice, that means we combine the best of algorithmic trading with a human overlay: our system might flag a promising trade, but we ensure it aligns with economic reality and our long-term thesis before committing capital. This marriage of man and machine gives Hushh a competitive advantage – we act faster than traditional funds and more thoughtfully than black-box quants.        </Text>
        <Text>
          Our investment philosophy is influenced by the wisdom of history’s great investors. We believe in preparation over prediction – echoing Howard Marks’ adage: “You can’t predict, [but] you can prepare.” We don’t pretend to know exactly where the market will go tomorrow; instead, we position the portfolio to thrive across a range of outcomes. By stress-testing our portfolio for different scenarios (recession, inflation spike, etc.), we ensure we are ready for whatever comes. This philosophy showed its value in 2024’s unpredictable climate – we hadn’t forecast every event, but we were prepared for volatility and seized the opportunities it created. We focus on asymmetric bets: investments where the upside potential vastly outweighs the downside risk. And when the facts change, we are not afraid to change our minds – staying flexible is key in a fast-evolving world. Our team lives by John Maynard Keynes’ famous mantra, “When the facts change, I change my mind”. We constantly update our models and views as new data emerges, ensuring our strategy adapts in real-time.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Crucially, Hushh’s macroeconomic positioning underpins our stock selection. We analyze global trends – interest rate cycles, inflation trajectories, technological disruptions, and policy shifts – to tilt the portfolio toward favorable winds. For instance, anticipating rising interest rates last year, we avoided long-duration assets and favored companies with strong cash flows and pricing power (able to weather inflation). Simultaneously, our AI models helped pinpoint timing: when to increase cash, when to deploy into dips, and when a rally had legs. This dynamic allocation added significant alpha, as we were one step ahead of the market’s mood swings. Another pillar of our strategy is risk management. We use rigorous position sizing and stop-loss protocols to cap downside. No single position (no matter how high our conviction) is allowed to jeopardize the fund. As a result, our volatility remained moderate even during market turmoil. By blending quantitative insight with macro wisdom and strict risk controls, Hushh has built a strategy designed to perform in any market climate – bull, bear, or in-between. It is this philosophy that gives us the confidence to invest boldly, yet the humility to course-correct as needed.

        Key Holdings & Sector Focus
      </Heading>
      <VStack align="start" spacing={4}>
        <Text>
          Our portfolio is concentrated in high-conviction investments across a few key sectors: Technology (especially AI and data), Energy, and select macro-sensitive plays. We believe these areas offer outsized growth potential in the coming years, and our capital is allocated accordingly. First and foremost is Artificial Intelligence and Semiconductors. We recognized early that generative AI and machine learning would revolutionize industries and drive explosive demand for computing power. Accordingly, one of our top holdings has been Nvidia (NVDA) – the leading provider of AI chips. Nvidia’s stock was a standout performer for us, as the company’s earnings and outlook soared on the back of unprecedented AI-driven demand for its GPUs. Our thesis was simple: in an AI-driven economy, compute power is king, and Nvidia is selling the shovels in a gold rush. This bet paid off tremendously in 2024, and we continue to hold a core position. We’ve trimmed tactically when the stock overshot and added on dips, but our conviction remains that Nvidia (and a handful of AI enablers) will be foundational to the new economy. Beyond NVDA, we invested in other AI and cloud ecosystem names – companies turning data into value. As the Economist famously noted, “data [is] the oil of the digital era”, and we own the modern wildcatters drilling for data: for example, enterprise software firms leveraging big data, and cloud platforms that store and analyze that data. These businesses enjoy strong secular tailwinds as every company races to incorporate AI and harness their data assets. We expect this AI & data sector to continue outperforming, driven by a virtuous cycle of innovation and productivity gains (Goldman Sachs estimates generative AI could eventually boost global GDP by 7%, a staggering impact that will translate into corporate earnings growth in the winners). Hushh is positioned to ride this wave, through both our equity picks and the AI we use internally to sharpen our edge.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Another sector focus is Energy – an area where we maintain high conviction, albeit with a nuanced approach. In the near term, we see opportunity in traditional energy companies. Global oil demand remains robust, and supply constraints (partly due to years of underinvestment and geopolitics) have kept prices elevated. We built positions in well-run oil & gas producers when they were out of favor, aligning with Warren Buffett’s perspective that buying oil stocks is essentially a bet on long-term oil prices. As Buffett quipped, “When you buy into a huge oil producer, how it works out is going to depend on the price of oil” – and we concur. Our holdings like Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and Chevron (CVX) (to name a couple) benefited as oil prices climbed and these firms threw off strong cash flows. We also view these positions as a hedge against inflation and geopolitical risk; in times of rising prices or conflict, energy assets can provide a safe harbor. At the same time, we are forward-looking and cognizant of the energy transition. Oil will not reign forever – indeed, Buffett himself has predicted that a cleaner energy source will usurp oil well within this century. Thus, a portion of our energy allocation is devoted to renewables and clean tech. We have targeted companies leading the charge in solar, wind, and battery technology, as well as electric vehicle infrastructure. These investments position us for the multi-decade shift to greener energy. We’re selective here, focusing on firms with viable business models and competitive moats (for example, a renewable energy developer with strong cash flows and contracts, rather than a pre-revenue tech hype). By balancing traditional energy and emerging clean tech, Hushh captures the “here and now” value of oil as well as the “future state” upside of renewables. This balanced energy strategy paid dividends in 2024: our oil stocks delivered cash returns and dividends, while our renewable plays appreciated as governments and companies doubled down on climate commitments. We expect both facets of energy to remain crucial – oil for its role in today’s economy, and renewables for their unstoppable growth in the new economy.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          Beyond tech and energy, we maintain exposure to other high-growth industries poised for outperformance. One such area is infrastructure and industrial technology. With supply-chain realignments and infrastructure spending on the rise globally, we invested in companies supplying the tools and software that modernize manufacturing and logistics. Another focus is healthcare and biotech: given aging demographics and recent breakthroughs (like mRNA technology), we selectively hold companies that are innovating in drug development and medical devices. These aren’t as large as our core tech positions, but provide diversification and long-term growth potential. We also opportunistically trade macroeconomic themes. For example, when interest rates were peaking, we took positions in interest-rate sensitive financial stocks (banks, insurers) at depressed prices, on the thesis that fears were overdone and margins would improve. Conversely, we shorted or avoided segments we found overvalued or structurally challenged – for instance, unprofitable speculative tech names with sky-high valuations and no clear path to profitability. This long/short overlay, guided by our AI signals, helped generate alpha and hedge risks. In summary, our key holdings reflect where we see significant growth ahead: leaders in AI & data, strategically chosen energy plays, and select positions in sectors like infrastructure and healthcare that stand to benefit from macro trends. Each investment in our portfolio comes with a clear thesis for why it will outperform, grounded in both data-driven analysis and fundamental conviction. We concentrate our capital in the best ideas – and as 2024 showed, a handful of well-chosen winners can drive outstanding results.

        Macroeconomic & Market Outlook
      </Heading>
      <VStack align="start" spacing={4}>
        <Text>
          As we look ahead, we remain both realistic and optimistic about the financial landscape. The macroeconomic backdrop for 2025-2026 will be shaped by a few dominant currents: the trajectory of interest rates and inflation, the revolution in AI and data, shifts in the energy sector, and other emerging trends from geopolitics to policy changes. Here’s our current outlook:
        </Text>
        <List spacing={2}>
          <ListItem>
            <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">Interest Rates & Inflation:</Text> We expect global interest rates to gradually moderate over the next two years, but not precipitously. Central banks, especially the U.S. Federal Reserve, have signaled a “higher for longer” stance on rates until inflation is decisively tamed. After aggressive rate hikes to combat last year’s inflation, the Fed is now cautious about cutting too fast. In fact, in late 2024 Fed officials scaled back projections for 2025 rate reductions, indicating that borrowing costs could stay elevated longer than markets hoped. We anticipate the Fed will likely begin modest rate cuts by mid-to-late 2025, possibly 25 basis points at a time, but will quickly pause if inflation remains above target. Inflation itself has been cooling from the peaks of 2022-23, yet remains sticky in parts of the economy (services and wages in particular). Renowned economist Larry Summers cautions that inflation remains persistently high across many regions, and we share that guarded view. We’re not out of the woods yet – core inflation could hover in the 3-4% range for longer than policymakers would like, especially if commodity prices or wages surprise to the upside. One wildcard is fiscal and trade policy: for example, any new tariffs or supply chain decoupling could add inflationary pressure. (Indeed, some economists note that proposed tariffs in the U.S. could keep inflation higher and rates elevated into 2026.) Our base case is that inflation will slowly trend down toward ~3% by late 2025, allowing central banks to ease policy mildly. However, we are prepared for a scenario where inflation re-accelerates, in which case rates could even rise further. In our portfolio, we’re positioned for this rate outlook by emphasizing stocks with strong balance sheets and pricing power, maintaining some exposure to commodities, and keeping duration short on any fixed-income holdings. In short, we predict a flattening then gently downward path for rates, and persistent but gradually easing inflation – a backdrop of cautious optimism.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">Artificial Intelligence & Data Revolution:</Text> The secular theme of AI transforming the economy is only gaining momentum. We believe we are on the cusp of an era akin to the internet boom, but potentially even more far-reaching. Advances in generative AI, automation, and data analytics are driving productivity gains and spawning entirely new business models. Major economists and banks have started quantifying this impact – Goldman Sachs projects that AI could increase annual global GDP by about 7% over a 10-year period. In practical terms, that’s trillions of dollars of new economic output and efficiency improvements. We expect 2025 and 2026 to bring wider AI adoption across industries: from manufacturing (through robotics and predictive maintenance) to finance (AI-driven risk management and trading, as we ourselves do) to healthcare (AI-assisted drug discovery and diagnostics). The companies enabling and capitalizing on this trend – those providing AI software, hardware, and services, as well as those successfully integrating AI to expand margins – will be big winners. However, investors should be selective; not every AI-themed company will prosper, and exuberance can lead to bubbles. Our approach is to remain overweight on AI and data beneficiaries, but focused on quality leaders with proven technology and execution. We also keep an eye on regulation in this space – governments are beginning to formulate AI oversight, which could impact certain business models. Net-net, we are bullish on the AI revolution and its ability to drive economic growth and corporate profits. Data, often called “the world’s most valuable resource” in the modern economy, will continue to accumulate value. Companies that own unique datasets or facilitate data-driven decisions (cloud platforms, data analytics firms) are effectively the new oil barons of the digital age. We foresee continued strong performance in this tech frontier, albeit with volatility, and we stand ready to adjust our holdings as the landscape evolves.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">Energy & Commodities:</Text> The energy sector is entering a dynamic period where traditional forces and new trends collide. On one hand, oil and gas remain critical to the global economy in the mid-2020s. Post-pandemic demand has been resilient, and emerging markets are still rapidly industrializing – meaning oil demand, while flattening in developed countries, is growing elsewhere. Supply-side discipline by major producers (OPEC+ production targets) and underinvestment in new drilling projects have tightened supply. We expect oil prices to remain in a relatively high range in 2025, barring a severe global recession. As a result, oil producers should continue to generate robust earnings and cash flow. As noted earlier, our strategy here mirrors Buffett’s logic that finite supply and steady demand imply higher long-term oil prices. However, the long-term trend is a shift toward renewable energy and decarbonization. Governments and corporations globally are investing heavily in clean energy infrastructure. We anticipate accelerated growth in solar and wind capacity, improved battery storage technology, and greater adoption of electric vehicles – especially as costs fall and technology improves. This transition creates opportunities (in clean tech companies) but also risks (for those entrenched in fossil fuels who fail to adapt). Our outlook is that through 2026, traditional energy will coexist with renewables in a delicate balance: oil and gas enjoying a profitable Indian summer of sorts, even as the seeds of their gradual demand decline are being sown. Additionally, other commodities will be in focus. Metals like lithium, copper, and nickel – vital for batteries and electrification – could see demand spikes and supply bottlenecks, potentially driving prices higher. We’re also monitoring agricultural and industrial commodities, which could be affected by climate events and geopolitical shifts. In sum, our energy outlook is “two-handed”: on one hand, bullish near-term on select oil/gas plays; on the other, long-term bullish on clean energy and the commodities underpinning it. Our portfolio will maintain exposure to both themes, adjusting weightings as macro data (like global oil inventory levels or renewable installation rates) dictate.
          </ListItem>
          <ListItem>
            <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">Emerging Trends & Wildcards:</Text> Several other factors will shape the market landscape into 2026. Geopolitical shifts – from trade tensions to conflicts – remain a source of volatility. We are watchful of U.S.-China relations, which could impact supply chains and technology flows. Any escalation could spur market risk-off moves, but also opportunities in regions or sectors that benefit from supply chain diversification (e.g. manufacturing in India or Vietnam). Fiscal policy is another trend; many governments are running large deficits and pursuing industrial policies (such as subsidies for chip manufacturing or EVs). This can boost certain industries but also adds to debt burdens. Currency dynamics may come into play if interest rate differentials shift – we might see a stronger dollar if the Fed stays hawkish, or conversely, a reversal if rate cuts begin. We hedge currency risk when appropriate, especially for any non-U.S. exposures. Technological disruption beyond AI is also on the horizon: for instance, quantum computing is inching closer, which in a few years could upend cybersecurity and encryption – we keep an eye on such long-tail developments. In the nearer term, fintech and digital finance continue to grow; the rise of digital payment platforms and possibly central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) could reshape banking and payment sectors. Another trend is the continued digitization of work – the hybrid/remote work model drives demand for cloud services and cybersecurity, areas in which we invest. Finally, we acknowledge climate change as a material financial risk – extreme weather events or new climate policies can suddenly affect insurance, agriculture, and energy markets. As investors, we must remain agile to these “wildcards.” Our outlook isn’t about predicting each event (an impossible task), but about building a robust portfolio that can withstand shocks and capitalize on surprises. To quote Howard Marks again, we focus on preparation, not prediction. Thus, we enter 2025 and 2026 with eyes wide open: expecting moderate global growth, cautious on inflation, bullish on innovation, and always ready to pivot as reality unfolds.

        2025-2026 Roadmap & Fund Growth Plan
      </Heading>
      <VStack align="start" spacing={4}>
        <Text>
          Hushh Investments is poised to expand and evolve over the next two years, leveraging our success to scale new heights. Our roadmap for 2025-2026 focuses on growing our assets under management (AUM), further refining our execution strategy, automating key processes, and scaling our operations – all while staying true to the core principles that brought us here. Here’s how we plan to grow and improve the fund:

            <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">Asset Growth & Capital Raising:</Text> With our strong track record now established, we plan to responsibly grow the fund’s capital base. In 2024, we saw increased interest from investors drawn to our performance and unique approach. We intend to open the fund to a select number of new limited partners in 2025, targeting an expansion of AUM by 50-100%. Importantly, we will only take on capital that we are confident can be put to work effectively. Bill Ackman often emphasizes the benefits of a concentrated, high-conviction portfolio – we will not dilute our returns or strategy by growing too fast. Instead, our growth will be measured and strategic, bringing in partners who share our long-term vision. We also plan to reinvest a portion of our own performance gains back into the fund, aligning our interests squarely with our investors. By 2026, our goal is to roughly double our AUM while maintaining the nimbleness and focus that has fueled our alpha generation.

            <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">Refining Execution & Strategy:</Text> Continuous improvement is in our DNA. We are committed to refining our investment process to stay ahead of the curve. One area of focus is enhancing our AI-driven models – we will train our algorithms on even larger datasets, incorporate new alternative data streams, and update our machine learning techniques to improve predictive power. Our research team is working on next-generation AI models that could better gauge market sentiment (using natural language processing on news and social media) and detect subtle patterns in price action that indicate accumulation or distribution. At the same time, we’ll refine our macroeconomic framework by integrating scenario analysis and probability-weighted outcomes more formally into our portfolio construction. Essentially, we want to quantify not just our base-case scenario, but also tail risks and alternate outcomes, and ensure the portfolio is optimally positioned for that distribution of possibilities. We believe this rigorous approach to macro positioning – thinking like chess players several moves ahead – will add even more consistency to our returns. Furthermore, we plan to expand our research team, potentially adding specialists in areas like energy markets or biotech, to deepen our expertise in core sectors. By broadening our knowledge base, we can uncover new high-conviction ideas and avoid blind spots. Execution-wise, we’ll also fine-tune our trade execution algorithms to minimize slippage and transaction costs as volumes grow. In sum, our strategy is one of relentless refinement: preserving what works (as evidenced by our results) while eagerly embracing new insights and technologies to sharpen our edge.

            <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">Automation & Technology Upgrades:</Text> As we scale, automation will be key to maintaining efficiency and performance. We are investing in advanced trading infrastructure to handle higher trade volumes seamlessly. In 2025, we’re rolling out an upgraded automated trading system that can execute a larger share of our orders algorithmically, based on parameters we set. This will allow us to react to market opportunities in milliseconds, eliminate human error in order execution, and free up our portfolio managers to focus on strategy rather than mechanics. We’re also implementing automated risk monitoring – systems that run 24/7 to flag any anomalies or risks (such as unusual portfolio concentration, sudden market moves against our positions, or margin utilization changes) and, if needed, automatically reduce exposures. The goal is to make our operation as real-time and self-regulating as possible. Additionally, we plan to enhance our back-office and reporting systems through automation. For example, investor reporting will be streamlined with a new portal that provides partners with up-to-date performance data, analytics, and transparency into the portfolio’s holdings and risk metrics. Embracing automation doesn’t mean removing the human element – rather, it amplifies our team’s capabilities. Our vision is a “cyborg” investment firm where AI and automation handle the grunt work and instantaneous decisions, guided by the strategic brainpower of experienced investors. By 2026, we expect the majority of our trading by volume to be automated, especially for high-frequency opportunities, with human oversight ensuring everything aligns with our high-level strategy. This blend of speed and savvy will enable Hushh to scale assets without skipping a beat in performance.

            <Text as="span" fontWeight="bold">Scaling Operations & Team:</Text> Growth in AUM and complexity requires a robust operational foundation. We are proactively scaling up our operations to support our ambitions. In 2025, we will bolster our operations and compliance team, ensuring we have top-tier controls and processes as we manage more capital. Cybersecurity is a priority as well – with the increasing cyber threats in finance, we will invest in state-of-the-art security measures to protect our data, algorithms, and client information. We’re also working on establishing a more formal governance structure, possibly including an advisory board of seasoned industry veterans to provide oversight and guidance as we expand. In terms of team growth, we plan to selectively hire exceptional talent in both technical and investment roles. Adding a data scientist or two, for instance, can further improve our AI models. Bringing in another portfolio manager with expertise in global macro could help us manage a larger multi-strategy book (e.g., adding opportunistic fixed-income or currency trades around our core equity portfolio). Every new hire will be vetted not just for skill, but for cultural fit – we have a small-team ethos of humility, innovation, and dedication that we intend to preserve. Moreover, we aim to institutionalize our processes so that the fund isn’t solely reliant on any one individual (including myself). This means documenting our strategies, creating playbooks for various market conditions, and ensuring knowledge transfer within the team. By 2026, we envision Hushh Investments as a more scalable organization: bigger in assets and reach, but just as nimble, cohesive, and focused in its daily execution. We want our investors to feel the benefits of growth (better resources, more capabilities) without any dilution of the personal touch and agility that a smaller firm offers.

          Our growth plan is ambitious, but we proceed with confidence and caution. We are building on a solid foundation of performance and a clearly defined strategy. We will not waver from our core philosophy or chase fads simply to gather assets. Every step in our 2025-2026 roadmap is aimed at enhancing our ability to deliver outstanding risk-adjusted returns to our investors. If market conditions become unfavorable or our strategies don’t scale as expected, we will adapt and adjust our growth plans – we won’t compromise on performance. To paraphrase a famous saying, we control what we can (our strategy execution and operations) and prepare for what we can’t control (market outcomes). This balanced approach to growth will guide us through the next chapter of Hushh’s evolution.

        Investor Message: Confidence with Humility
      </Heading>
      <VStack align="start" spacing={4}>
        <Text>
          To our valued investors, we extend our deepest gratitude for your trust and partnership. The past year’s success is our success – yours and ours – and we are honored to have you alongside us on this journey. As we forge ahead into 2025 and beyond, our message to you is one of opportunity balanced with risk, confidence tempered by humility. We see a world brimming with opportunity: technological breakthroughs are unlocking new avenues for growth, markets are presenting mispricings for us to exploit, and our strategy has never been stronger. We feel a deep conviction in our positions and our approach – the same high-conviction mindset that drove our outperformance in the past will guide our future decisions. However, we also recognize that investing is a realm of uncertainties. We stay humble in the face of the market. At Hushh, every victory is celebrated briefly, then analyzed for lessons, and we constantly remind ourselves that we must earn our keep every single day. As confident as we are in our process, we will never be arrogant; the market has a way of humbling those who take success for granted. Our promise to you is that we will remain vigilant and adaptable. If the facts change, we will change our strategy – swiftly and decisively. If risks rise, we will take protective action. If new opportunities emerge, we will research them rigorously and, if worthy, pounce with conviction.

          Transparency is another cornerstone of our partnership with you. We believe you deserve to know not just what we are doing with your capital, but why. We will continue to provide candid updates, whether in times of prosperity or adversity. In our communications, we aim to give you a window into our thinking – from the rationale behind key holdings to our analysis of macro trends. You’ll hear from us regularly about how we see the world and how the portfolio is positioned. We invite questions and open dialogue; an informed investor is an empowered investor. This culture of openness keeps us accountable and grounded. It’s easy to trumpet successes; we will also be upfront about challenges or shifts in our views. We consider this level of honesty not just good business practice, but the right thing to do.

          As we chart the path ahead, we encourage you to look past the short-term noise and focus on the horizon with us. There will inevitably be bumps in the road – a volatile earnings season, a sudden rate scare, maybe even a market correction. Such events can be uncomfortable, but they are also the very source of future returns. By staying the course and even leaning in when fear grips the market, we can turn these episodes to our advantage. Remember, some of our best investments were made during periods of uncertainty and concern. We ask for your continued trust and patience during those times. Our approach will remain methodical and data-driven, not swayed by headlines or herd behavior. In the spirit of Warren Buffett’s advice, we will strive to be “fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful,” seeking value where the crowd overlooks it. That contrarian mindset, paired with rigorous analysis, is how we intend to keep delivering superior results for you.

Our forward-looking thesis is simple: innovation and insight will drive wealth creation, and we plan to be at the forefront of both. We invite you to continue this journey with us, to invest in the future of wealth side by side. As always, we remain invested right alongside you, our interests 100% aligned. Every decision we make is with the goal of protecting and growing your capital.
