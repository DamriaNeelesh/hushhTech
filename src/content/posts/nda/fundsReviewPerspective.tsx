        <List spacing={2} pl={4}>
          <ListItem>• The fund primarily trades AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA—businesses with strong moats and massive free cash flow.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• “If you’re going to rent out stocks, at least rent out castles, not sandcastles.”</ListItem>
        </List>

        <List spacing={2} pl={4}>
          <ListItem>• Generates passive income while maintaining long-term ownership of the best businesses.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• Converts market inefficiencies into cash flow—Buffett loves “getting paid while you wait.”</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• This reduces reliance on unpredictable short-term market movements.</ListItem>
        </List>
        <ListItem>✅ Strong Cash Reserves for Opportunistic Buying:</ListItem>
        <List spacing={2} pl={4}>

          <ListItem>• “We love having cash when others panic.”</ListItem>
        </List>
        <ListItem>✅ Hedging Protects Against Permanent Capital Loss:</ListItem>
        <List spacing={2} pl={4}>
          <ListItem>• The fund isn’t gambling on naked leverage—instead, it hedges its delta risk.</ListItem>

        </List>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        <strong>What Warren Would Question:</strong>
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} pl={4}>
        <ListItem>⚠ The Use of Margin & Derivatives Risk Exposure:</ListItem>

          <ListItem>• Buffett hates leverage and derivatives misuse.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• He would want to ensure margin is used conservatively and that the fund never risks “permanent capital loss.”</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• “If you’re playing the long game, you don’t want a margin call wiping you out.”</ListItem>
        </List>
        <ListItem>⚠ Does This Create Enduring Competitive Advantages?</ListItem>
        <List spacing={2} pl={4}>
          <ListItem>• Buffett prefers businesses that compound forever—not just extracting premium for short-term gains.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• He would ask, “Does this strategy build long-term competitive strength or just short-term yield?”</ListItem>

      </List>

        <ListItem>⚠ Would This Work in a Prolonged Bear Market?</ListItem>
        <List spacing={2} pl={4}>
