          <Text mt={2}>For profitable fintech firms, EBITDA multiples are a common valuation metric. Recent data indicates that fintech companies with EBITDA in the range of $5 million to $10 million have been valued at approximately 12.3 times EBITDA.</Text>

          <Text>â€¢ Annual Net Cash Flow (EBITDA): $375,000 (monthly) Ã— 12 = $4.5 million</Text>

          <Text mt={2}>Although HushhTech.com is in its early stages, revenue multiples can provide additional context. Fintech companies with revenues between $1 million and $5 million have been valued at approximately 2.7 times revenue.</Text>
          <Text mt={2}><strong>Calculation:</strong></Text>
          <Text>â€¢ Annual Revenue: Assuming the net cash flow represents net profit after expenses, and considering typical fintech profit margins, the annual revenue could be estimated around $9 million.</Text>
