            1.1 Equity Market Risk
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Description: The fund is heavily concentrated in equities of free cash flow (FCF)-rich businesses such as Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN). Market downturns, economic crises, or company-specific issues could significantly impact the portfolio.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: The fund employs options strategies to generate income and offset market declines, but this does not eliminate exposure to equity risk.

            1.2 Volatility Risk
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Description: Options premiums are sensitive to changes in implied volatility. A sudden reduction in volatility could reduce income generation potential, while spikes in volatility could increase losses on written options.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: The fund uses historical volatility modeling and dynamic hedging to manage volatility risk.

          <Heading as="h4" size="md" mb={2}>
            1.3 Interest Rate Risk
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Description: Rising interest rates can increase discount rates, negatively impacting the valuation of high-growth companies. This could affect core positions like technology stocks.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: The fund actively monitors macroeconomic trends and adapts the portfolio to include more defensive positions when necessary.

          <Heading as="h4" size="md" mb={2}>
            1.4 Currency Risk
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Description: Although primarily focused on U.S.-listed equities, some underlying companies have significant international exposure, introducing currency risk.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: Currency risks are inherent but monitored as part of the macroeconomic analysis.

            2.1 Limited Diversification
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Description: The fund’s strategy focuses on a small number of high-quality businesses. This concentrated approach increases dependency on a few companies’ performance.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: While this increases potential returns, it also amplifies risks. Investors should have a high risk tolerance and long-term horizon.

            2.2 Sector-Specific Risk
          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Description: The portfolio is heavily weighted toward technology and consumer discretionary sectors, making it susceptible to sector-wide downturns.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: The fund plans periodic sector reviews and may diversify into other sectors if opportunities arise.

          </Heading>
          <Text>
            Description: The use of cash-secured puts and margin for covered calls can lead to liquidity pressures, particularly during sharp market declines or margin calls.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: The fund maintains a liquidity reserve of 20–25% of NAV to meet collateral needs and seize market opportunities.

          <Text>
            Covered Calls: The upside is capped if the stock price rises significantly beyond the call strike.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: Strike prices are carefully chosen to balance premium income with potential upside.

          <Text>
            Cash-Secured Puts: The fund could be forced to buy the underlying stock at a higher-than-market price if the stock price drops significantly.
          </Text>
          <Text mt={2}>
            Mitigation: Strike prices are set below intrinsic valuation to ensure favorable entry points.

            Writing options exposes the fund to potentially unlimited losses if the market moves against the positions.

            Mitigation: All written options are fully collateralized, and stop-loss thresholds are pre-defined.
