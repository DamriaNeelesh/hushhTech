        Gloomy Monday in Seattle, Gloomy Markets Everywhere
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ The major indices hovered around breakeven most of the day, then took a modest dip into the close.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Meanwhile, the Pacific Northwest skies matched the market mood‚Äîgray and drizzly. I joked about waking up in warm Qatar, but for now, it‚Äôs me and my teenage kid here in the rain.</ListItem>

        Staying Busy with Legal & Tax Work
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Spent the weekend deep in paperwork for SEC & ADGM compliance. I can‚Äôt wait to automate all these processes so the Fund runs like a seamless, unstoppable machine. But hey, that‚Äôs the fun of building.</ListItem>

        Aggressive ‚ÄúSell the Wall‚Äù Execution
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Kicked off Monday by rolling over our higher-delta positions to lock in fresh premium.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ In the last 30 minutes, we capitalized on rising RSI levels to delta-hedge and collect short-term ‚Äúrental income‚Äù from new walls.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ The net result? We monetized fear and volatility across key names (BRK.B, AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA, META, AMZN, plus a hefty rollover on NIO).</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ We also took a moment to appreciate Warren Buffett‚Äôs latest shareholder letter‚Äîsome choice quotes about owning great businesses forever reaffirmed why we anchor in free cash flow ‚Äúaces.‚Äù</ListItem>

        <ListItem>1. NAV: $8.402M</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Daily Change: ‚Äì2.96% (mark-to-market)</ListItem>

        Rolling the Wall on BRK.B
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Warren‚Äôs annual letter fueled a mini-breakout in BRK.B. We took the opportunity to sell calls (‚Äúthe wall‚Äù) at elevated premiums, capturing that ‚ÄúBuffett bounce‚Äù in real-time.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ We remain net long Berkshire‚Äîjust ‚Äúrenting it out‚Äù short-term while staying owners of the best compounding machine on Earth.</ListItem>

        Hedges Doing Their Job
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Our hedges triggered near the close, reducing net delta in the face of a market that looked ready to fade.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Meanwhile, RSI signals on core holdings (AAPL, GOOGL, etc.) popped, letting us roll existing options for bigger premiums.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Outcome: $30k+ in daily income from rent, even as our mark-to-market took a mild hit.</ListItem>
      </List>

        Free Cash Flow Aces On Sale
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Sure, the day ended ‚Äì2.96% on NAV, but that‚Äôs not alarming. We used the downdraft to roll deeper in, planning to buy more if dips continue.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ Our stance remains ‚Äúown the best, monetize the rest.‚Äù</ListItem>
      </List>

        4. Closing Perspective
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Even on a red day, we locked in ~$30k+ in ‚Äúrental income,‚Äù reaffirming the power of ‚ÄúSell the Wall.‚Äù
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ We own the best free cash flow businesses in the world.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ We rent them out via short-term options, capturing big-time premium when the market‚Äôs fearful or volatile.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ We reinvest every dime back into the portfolio, compounding alpha and building unstoppable momentum for 2025.</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Looking Ahead
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>‚Ä¢ We‚Äôll keep an eye on macro signals (Fed chatter, global politics), but our game plan is consistent:</ListItem>
        <ListItem>1. Sell weekly or daily ‚Äúwalls‚Äù for immediate premium.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>2. Maintain enough liquidity for opportunistic buys on these dips.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>3. Stay net delta-long on the cream-of-the-crop companies we love.</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Bottom line: Even in gloom, we rake in aloha. This is exactly how we designed the strategy. Onward we go, building the next wave of alpha day by day.
