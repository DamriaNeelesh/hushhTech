        1. Market Backdrop & Fund Performance
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4}>
        A Tough Day for Markets, But Aloha Keeps Flowing
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4}>
        It was a brutal day in the markets. Major indices took a hit, led by a steep drop in tech stocks:
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Dow Jones (DJI): 43,239.50 (-0.45%)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ S&P 500 (SPX): 5,861.57 (-1.59%)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Russell 2000 (RUT): 2,139.66 (-1.59%)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Nasdaq 100 (NDX): 20,550.95 (-2.75%)</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        With the Nasdaq down nearly 3%, tech-heavy portfolios felt the squeeze, and our NAV declined -3.88% today as a result.

        Portfolio Hit by Tech Sell-Off, But Aloha Income Still Prints
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>â€¢ NAV: $9.098M (-3.88% daily drop ðŸ©¸)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Cash & Sweep Vehicle: $7.810M</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Margin Requirement Due by EOD Tomorrow: $341,538 (fully manageable)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Daily Aloha Income from Rolling Walls: $16,785.21</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Despite the market pain, our Sell the Wall strategy continued generating risk-adjusted cash flowâ€”ensuring we still walk away with fresh alpha, even on a red day.

      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Brutal Selling in Tech â€“ We Took Hits, But We Keep Fighting
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Apple (AAPL): -3.10 to $237.26, ($20,366.40) loss on the day</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Tesla (TSLA): -9.50 to $281.30, ($25,795.60) loss</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ NIO: ($2,287.30) loss</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        The broader sell-off in mega-cap tech names dragged down the portfolio, but we leveraged the fear by rolling calls and monetizing short-term volatility.

      <Text mb={4}>
        Bright Spots â€“ Market Volatility = Opportunity
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Micro E-Mini Nasdaq Futures (MNQ): +$10,600.00, helping hedge part of the tech sell-off</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Short-Term Aloha Income (Options Premiums): $16,785.21</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        While we ran out of time to execute additional rolls (leaving ~$25K on the table), our cash flow machine continues to perform even on the worst days.

        3. Strategy & Execution Insights
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Sell The Wall â€“ The Game Plan Remains Intact
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>â€¢ We aggressively sold and rolled calls on AAPL, TSLA, and BRK.B, capturing premium at higher IV levels.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ We used the NVDA post-earnings lull to lock in premium on covered calls, despite the stock reporting strong numbers.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Cash-secured puts were deployed on AAPL and TSLA, ensuring we accumulate more shares at lower prices if the selling continues.</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Margin Awareness & Risk Controls
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>â€¢ With a $341K margin requirement due, we are not forced sellers and have more than enough liquidity to cover.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ The NAV drop is paper loss only, and we continue printing real Aloha cash flow daily.</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Why We Need Full Automation â€“ Todayâ€™s Execution Cost Us
      </Text>
      <List spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>â€¢ We left significant income on the table simply due to manual execution speed limits.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>â€¢ Next Steps:</ListItem>
        <ListItem>1. Automated Trading Execution â€“ No more time-based execution misses.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>2. AI-Driven Rebalancing â€“ Real-time strike price adjustments based on live market data.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>3. Fully 24/7 Trading Engine â€“ No more missed opportunities due to manual order flow.</ListItem>

        4. Closing Perspective â€“ The Bigger Picture
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Today was brutal, no doubt. But weâ€™ve seen this story before.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4}>
        ðŸ“‰ NAV dropped -3.88% today â€“ but we still pulled in $16.7K in premium income while maintaining full liquidity.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4}>
        ðŸ’° $7.810M in cash ensures we can buy any dip in our core FCF winners.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4}>
        ðŸ“ˆ Sell the Wall keeps proving its power â€“ even when markets are panicking, we get paid.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4}>
        This is why we play the long game.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Tomorrow, we roll again. More walls, more premium, more Aloha. The machine is being built, and soon, weâ€™ll be unstoppable.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4}>
        Onward. ðŸš€
