      <Text mb={4}>
        Our overarching priority is to invest in extraordinary businesses underpinned by robust fundamentals, while employing prudent hedging and option-selling strategies to capture recurring income. Today‚Äôs results, supported by significant volatility around Nvidia‚Äôs earnings announcement, reaffirm our discipline and highlight the ongoing prospects for generating both sustainable returns and prudent risk management.

        <ListItem>
          ‚Ä¢ Nvidia (NVDA) reported outstanding results after the bell, confirming their leadership in AI and data center technologies. However, the stock‚Äôs subsequent after-hours movement has been relatively subdued, an outcome we anticipated given the market‚Äôs lofty expectations.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          ‚Ä¢ Volatility Outlook: Higher implied volatility leading into the announcement provided the Fund an optimal window to sell calls (our ‚ÄúSell the Wall‚Äù strategy), securing notable premium. Whether NVDA gaps up or remains flat in the coming sessions, we‚Äôve effectively monetized fear-driven pricing, preserving upside through rolling if needed.

          1. Net Gains YTD: We have now realized $735,246.99 in net income thus far in 2025‚Äîoutperforming the broader market‚Äôs more muted progress.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          2. New High-Water Mark: Our NAV stands at $8.926M, the highest level this year. While pleasing, we remain committed to maintaining a conservative underwriting process and disciplined approach to risk.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          3. Cash & Sweep: Holding $8.368M in ready capital, we are positioned to capitalize on opportunities arising from potential mispricing or overreactions, whether from earnings or macro developments.

        <ListItem>
          4. Option ‚ÄúRent‚Äù Income: Consistent option-selling has produced strong recurring ‚Äúrental income.‚Äù In periods such as these, when volatility spikes around events like Nvidia‚Äôs release, the yield on our calls increases markedly, contributing to both cash flow and downside risk mitigation.

        Navigating Risk & Delta Exposures
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4}>
        We employ hedging methods designed to limit excessive exposures while allowing the Fund to benefit from the upward trajectory of high-quality equity holdings. This discipline was particularly evident in the run-up to Nvidia‚Äôs results, where we captured elevated call premiums without overextending net long risk. Our approach is as follows:

      <List spacing={2} mb={4}>
        <ListItem>
          ‚Ä¢ Selling Calls at Elevated Implied Volatility: By selling calls on NVDA prior to earnings, we extracted substantial premium while preserving the option to roll up if the stock surges, thus retaining a portion of potential upside.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          ‚Ä¢ Balanced Core Holdings: Alongside selective hedging, we continue to hold free cash flow stalwarts such as Apple, Tesla, Google, and Berkshire Hathaway. Any moderate pullbacks in these names are typically offset by the collected option premiums, fortifying our net returns.

        Forward-Looking Considerations

        <ListItem>
          1. Near-Term Outlook: Upcoming economic data‚Äîparticularly relating to inflation‚Äîmay trigger additional volatility. We plan to maintain an adequate cash reserve to purchase assets if the market responds irrationally.

          2. Earnings Continuation: As the tail end of earnings season approaches, any isolated corporate disappointments could create attractive entry points.
        </ListItem>
        <ListItem>
          3. Strategic Discipline: While reaching a new high-water mark is commendable, our mission centers on consistent compounding of returns. We do not deviate from this strategy to chase short-lived gains.

        Final Remarks
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4}>
        We consider these strong results to be an outgrowth of focused underwriting principles combined with measured option-based monetization. The stability of our cash position, disciplined investment posture, and proven methodology for capturing event-driven premiums position the Aloha Alpha Fund for enduring performance in a wide range of market conditions. I remain optimistic about the future, confident in our capacity to manage downside risk while pursuing exceptional long-term returns for our investors.
