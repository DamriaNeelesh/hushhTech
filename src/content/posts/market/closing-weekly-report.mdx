## Strategic Commentary

“Sell the Wall” Strategy Execution:  
Today’s results validate the effectiveness of systematically monetizing free cash flow businesses through covered calls and cash-secured puts. This disciplined approach captures consistent premium income while managing downside risks.

- **Options Strategies in Focus:**
  - Covered calls generated predictable income, leveraging high-IV periods before earnings.
  - Cash-secured puts allowed opportunistic entry into core names like Tesla and Nvidia at favorable prices.
- **Risk Management:**
  - Maintained conservative margin exposure, leveraging cash positions ($4.445M) to preserve flexibility.
  - Managed RSI indicators across positions to identify oversold opportunities while avoiding overbought traps.

## Outlook

- **Core Focus:** Prioritize high-liquidity businesses with strong free cash flow for sustainable alpha generation.
- **Tactical Adjustments:**
  - Rotate capital into healthcare and consumer staples to hedge against potential valuation compressions in tech and semiconductors.
  - Continue leveraging brokerage money market accounts (5.4% yield) for idle cash to optimize portfolio returns.
- **Key Near-Term Goals:**
  1. Maintain weekly premium income targets above 1% of NAV.
  2. Dynamically adjust positions based on RSI and macroeconomic indicators.
  3. Prepare for February earnings season, targeting volatility-driven opportunities.

## Closing Note

The Fund’s performance underscores the value of combining disciplined execution with market insights. By focusing on free cash flow giants and leveraging behavioral inefficiencies, we continue to turn volatility into consistent alpha. As Charlie Munger would say:  
*"The big money is not in the buying or selling, but in the waiting."*

Let’s stay patient, deliberate, and focused on maximizing returns while navigating market complexity. Onward to creating more Aloha and Alpha!
