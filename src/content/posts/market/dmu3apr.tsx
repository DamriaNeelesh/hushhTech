          Aloha Alphas - howdy ðŸ‘‹? Radio silence here tells me we are in a house of pain.

          Hope everyone is doing well and has recovered from the white wash we saw going into the close today. From a ðŸ¤« Fund standpoint it was the single biggest drawdown day from our high water mark a few weeks ago (20% from peak to lows yesterday) since we started the fund in April last year so it was a very humbling moment. We closed down ~23% on our NLV - most of the carnage we suffered yesterday was due to our concentrated position in AAPL which was down 10%. On a brighter note we managed to lock in 5% (250k) in aloha income along the way which is as the only saving grace thanks to rolling over 200 walls of pain to lock and raised our cash position to 3.66M.

          By the time market closed, I have to say I was absolutely beat up thanks to day 2 of Jet Lag and the back and forth from Sharjah to Abu Dhabi car travel really kills your soul.

          We plan to stick to our strategy and continue to sell the wall using our cash position on the names we love as we continue to see the carnage.

          My wishful thinking is telling me we will get a bounce soon, perhaps in the next day or two but let's see what happens but that also might be short lived xx

          Spx closed right under the 5400 mark which has been the lows from Sep last year. Key level to watch as Rajesh Rajat and other technical gurus have pointed out.

          It's a good time to get your buy list ready as we're going to have some grand sales soon. Just make sure you have cash on hand to buy blood: ðŸ©¸.

        <Text>
          We continue to buy blood by selling the wall - and plan to do the same today and rest of the week.
