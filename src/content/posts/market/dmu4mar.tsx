          Another day, another bag of premium scooped from the market's indecision. The Sell the Wall Aloha Program is printing like a dream, and we're marching towards our first $1M in 2025 Aloha income. That's right—by the end of this month, we'll likely be crossing that milestone.

          ⚡️ Trading & Strategy Notes
        </Heading>
        <Text>
          It was a super choppy day. Delta exposure was all over the place, and the hedging game was on overdrive. RSI and volatility swings gave us multiple opportunities to roll our positions, keeping the theta burn working in our favor while making sure we remained delta-neutral.
        </Text>
        <Text>
          👉 Key Takeaway? On days like today, automation is king. Manually keeping delta balanced is a workout, but with the right execution model, we'll be extracting even more Aloha income from pure delta hedging and RSI-driven roll decisions.

          We absolutely love selling the wall. It's like getting paid to let the market be wrong for a little longer. 😝

          📈 Market Insights & Humor of the Day
        </Heading>
        <List spacing={2}>
          <ListItem>• "The Dow dropped 1.5%" → You mean it's on sale? Let's be real, nobody should be panicking. We'll happily sell puts on the dip and roll them into even more Aloha income.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• "Tech stocks held up better than expected" → That's cute. Meanwhile, we're rolling call walls and cashing theta checks like it's our job.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>• "The Fed still hasn't figured out what it's doing" → Fantastic. That means volatility stays juicy, and we keep selling insurance to the indecisive traders.</ListItem>

          💡 Looking Ahead
        </Heading>
        <List spacing={2}>
          <ListItem>1. Scaling Up the Strategy: Now that we're nearly at $1M in 2025 Aloha Income, we'll start deploying more capital into delta-hedged premium strategies. More cash-secured puts. More call walls. More premium.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>2. Refining the Automation: We already know that rolling the wall is a cash machine. Next up: scaling the automated delta hedging system to squeeze every last drop of inefficiency out of the market.</ListItem>
          <ListItem>3. Hitting $2M in Premiums by Mid-Year: It's not just about income—it's about reinvestment. The Aloha income is compounding back into BRK.B, AAPL, and GOOGL, and every roll builds a bigger foundation for the strategy.</ListItem>
        </List>
