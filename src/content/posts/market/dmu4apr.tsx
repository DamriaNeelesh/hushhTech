          We ran into lots of technical issues with Schwab today while Selling the Wall into the close due to networking issues - connections kept failing so we were able to only roll over 13 walls of pain- ended up locking about 79K (1.5%) in aloha income.

          For the week ðŸ¤« Fund is down 30% :( - we at this point have given up all our profits we had made in aloha income over the last 3 months. I wonder how much more the pain would have been if we didn't have the aloha component giving us income along the way. Will do some analysis on this as that will talk for itself.
