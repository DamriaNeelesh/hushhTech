# My First Post

Welcome to the community! This is the **first post** in our *Announcements* category. We will share news and updates here.

- This post is written in Markdown.
- It can include **formatting**, links, images, etc.
- The layout and styling will be handled by your React components/CSS as before.

For example, here's an image:

![Community logo](/images/community-logo.png)

And here's some inline code: \`<CommunityWidget />\`.

Enjoy the post!
