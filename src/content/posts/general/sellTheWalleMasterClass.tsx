          <Text>
            Owning world-class free cash flow businesses like Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Meta is great. But just sitting on them? That’s suboptimal. Sell the Wall systematically sells out-of-the-money calls, capturing premium income from overly bullish investors or those hedging positions.

          <Text>
            Just like AWS rents out cloud computing, we rent out upside exposure via covered call sales. We sell overpriced options during volatility spikes, capturing steady returns.
