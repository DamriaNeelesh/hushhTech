        Q1 2025 Investment Perspectives – Letter to Fund A Partners
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Dear Partners of Fund A,
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        It was the best of times, it was… an interesting time. The first quarter of 2025 started with markets riding high on optimism, only to hit a few unexpected bumps along the way. In true Buffett fashion, we remained focused on the long game, “surfing the VIX” when volatility spiked rather than panicking. By doing so, we not only preserved your capital but managed to grow it modestly – a result we celebrate with humility. We credit much of this quarter’s success to being in the right place at the right time as macro cycles turned, rather than any genius on our part. In this letter, I’ll review Q1 2025’s market backdrop, share our outlook for Q2, and update you on how Fund A is executing its unique strategy (selling puts/calls, maximizing “aloha income”, and investing in free cash flow kings/queens/aces) to generate alpha. As always, our focus is on long-term value creation, prudent risk management, and a little bit of Warren Buffett-style wisdom served with a modern, Gen-Z/Millennial-friendly twist.

        Q1 2025 Market Review: Riding the Waves
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Global Public Equities: After a blockbuster 2024, global stocks hit a reality check in Q1. The S&P 500 ended the quarter down roughly 4%, marking its weakest quarter in years. What happened? In short, the AI frenzy that drove markets last year took a breather. There were “growing doubts about the artificial-intelligence trade” as investors realized even the Magnificent 7 tech giants can’t defy gravity forever. Those seven mega-cap tech stocks (our era’s FAANGs) hit “a patch of black ice” when investors balked at their surging capital expenditures on AI and cloud infrastructure. In other words, Wall Street paused to ask: Are these lofty valuations still justified? Concurrently, the new U.S. administration’s policies injected uncertainty. President Trump’s return brought a tariff agenda that sparked fears of a trade war redux, which “might upend the U.S. economy”. Indeed, new tariffs threaten to weigh on global growth and add a fresh dose of inflation risk. This one-two punch of AI hype cooling and trade tensions meant developed market equities gave back some gains...

      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Digital Assets: Crypto winter? More like crypto polar vortex in Q1. After a euphoric end to 2024, Bitcoin and Ethereum had a harsh reversal to start 2025. Bitcoin dropped about 6.5% in Q1 – its worst first quarter since 2020 – and Ethereum plunged by an eye-popping 38%, an unprecedented downturn for Ether. This pullback, ironically, came just as many institutions were warming up to crypto. The volatility was fueled by broader risk-off sentiment (when stocks and tech sold off, speculative digital assets followed) and some crypto-specific knocks (including a few high-profile hacks, and regulatory overhangs despite a new U.S. administration that’s more crypto-friendly on paper). Notably, President Trump’s first crypto-related executive order struck an optimistic tone about “support[ing] the responsible growth and use of digital assets”, which could pave the way for clearer regulations. From a long-term perspective, we see the crypto space maturing: Bitcoin’s volatility has actually trended down (it averaged ~70% annualized volatility in 2020-22, now below 50% post-2023), and use-cases like stablecoins are proving real utility in payments. For Fund A, digital assets remain a small slice of our strategy – essentially a volatility kicker and hedge against monetary debasement. We approach it like venture capital: size appropriately, focus on high-conviction projects, and be prepared for a bumpy ride. Q1’s crypto swoon was humbling, but it hasn’t dented our belief that blockchain and digital assets (the “internet of value”) will play a significant role in the future of finance. If anything, lower prices can present attractive entry points, and we cautiously added on weakness, staying within our risk guardrails. To channel our inner Buffett: “Be greedy when others are fearful” – but carefully and within limits, as greed in crypto must be tempered by rigorous risk management.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        AI & Data Infrastructure: A special mention is warranted for AI and data infrastructure – the darlings of 2024’s market and a core theme for us. As noted, Q1 saw a bit of an AI reality check. The market’s initial love affair with all things AI (from machine learning software to semiconductor chips) cooled as investors started asking for actual earnings and not just excitement. That said, the secular trend is unmistakably strong: companies across every sector are investing in AI and data capabilities to stay competitive. We see this as analogous to the early internet or mobile booms – there will be volatility, winners, and losers, but those who can harness AI effectively will have a tremendous edge in the long run. Our stance is that AI will enhance human intelligence rather than replace it. In practice, that means two things: (1) In our investment process, we use AI-driven tools to augment our human decision-making (for instance, algorithms sift through data to flag opportunities, but final calls are made by our team’s seasoned judgment – it’s AI + HI, Human Intelligence). And (2) in our portfolio, we favor businesses that leverage AI to empower their workforce or customers, not just as a buzzword. Think of companies using AI to improve supply chains, customer service, or product design – these are real, cash-generating applications of AI that can drive free cash flow growth (as opposed to moonshot AI research projects with distant payoffs). We remain bullish on picks-and-shovels plays in data infrastructure: the cloud providers, chipmakers, and cybersecurity firms that make the AI revolution possible. Some of these names got caught in Q1’s tech sell-off, which in our view is an opportunity to accumulate more at reasonable prices. Our long-term conviction here is unshaken. As one tech pundit said, “AI is the new electricity” – a pervasive utility – and we want to own stakes in the grid and power plants of that new AI-driven economy.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Commodities & Macroeconomic Themes: An intriguing development in Q1 was the resurgence of gold. Gold lived up to its reputation as a safe-haven asset, surging to record highs. In fact, gold breached $3,000/oz for the first time ever, and ended the quarter up about 14% year-to-date. Investors flocked to the yellow metal as a hedge against the very uncertainties we discussed: geopolitical tensions, tariff-induced inflation fears, and a wobbling stock market. This was a timely reminder that in a world of fiat paper, real assets like gold shine when confidence wavers. We maintain a position in gold (and gold miners) as a small but important diversifier – essentially an insurance policy in our portfolio. Other commodities were mixed: oil prices fluctuated but remained range-bound in the $60-70/barrel range as global supply outstripped demand (there’s talk of an oil glut keeping prices in check). Industrial metals like copper held steady, balancing China’s continued recovery with global growth uncertainties. Meanwhile, inflation metrics in major economies showed a tug-of-war between opposing forces: disinflation in goods (post supply-chain normalization) versus sticky inflation in services and wages. Central banks trod carefully – after aggressive hikes in 2022-2023, most have hit pause or even begun easing. In the U.S., the Fed didn’t hike further in Q1, and markets anticipate maybe one or two small rate cuts later in 2025 if growth decelerates. Europe’s central bank is in a similar wait-and-see mode amid its sluggish economy. Notably, Japan is the outlier, finally flirting with raising rates after decades of ultra-easy policy (a sign of rising inflationary pressure there). Big picture, we see a macro environment at an inflection: Will the global economy achieve a soft landing, or will rising costs and policy missteps trip it into stagflation? We don’t have a crystal ball, but we’re alert to a range of scenarios. Our portfolio is positioned for resilience: if the economy stays strong, our equity holdings should continue generating robust cash flows; if a downturn hits, our option income strategies and gold/defensive positions provide buffers. In every scenario, we emphasize capital preservation first. Our mantra is “don’t lose money,” which guides us to think about what can go wrong before chasing what could go right.

        Q2 2025 Outlook: Cautious Optimism and Opportunistic Moves
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Looking ahead to Q2 2025, we carry a stance of cautious optimism. After the Q1 shake-out, some froth has come off the market, which is healthy. The fear and greed pendulum swung a bit more toward fear in Q1 (the Crypto Fear & Greed Index, for example, dropped to a neutral 47, from extreme greed last year). In our view, this reset in sentiment provides a better backdrop for deploying capital than three months ago. However, risks abound, and we enumerate a few key themes and our game plan for each:
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        <ListItem>Global Equities – Selectivity is Key: Valuations in certain pockets (U.S. mega-cap tech, for instance) are still rich, even after Q1’s dip. It’s a classic elevated valuation environment. Rather than broad market bets, we’re focusing on specific opportunities. We continue to favor companies with pricing power, strong cash flows, and secular tailwinds – those that can weather an economic soft patch and thrive thereafter. Europe and emerging markets present selective value; Europe has lower multiples but needs catalysts (perhaps a fiscal stimulus or clearer path out of its energy issues), while some EM countries offer growth at a reasonable price if one can stomach the volatility. We’re watching for any excessive pessimism that could create a buying opportunity – for example, if trade war rhetoric intensifies and hammers Asian markets irrationally, we’d be ready to increase exposure to high-quality businesses there at a discount. In the U.S., Q2 is likely to bring more clarity on corporate earnings. We’ll be scrutinizing earnings reports for signs of margin pressure (wages, input costs) and for commentary on capital spending plans. Any indication that companies are reining in capex or slowing hiring could actually be bullish for profits (and thus stocks) in the near term, albeit a potential red flag for the economy later. We maintain a balanced barbell of offense and defense: growth-oriented names tied to AI/data on one side, and stable dividend-payers on the other. If volatility spikes again, we won’t hesitate to “surf the VIX” by selling volatility into fear – much like a surfer catching a wave that others are afraid of, we find that elevated volatility is the best time to write options (a key part of our Q2 playbook, as detailed later).</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Interest Rates & Credit – Fed Watching and “Renting” Capital: All eyes are on central banks as Q2 unfolds. Our base case is that the Fed will hold rates steady this quarter, with perhaps a bias toward cutting if inflation keeps trending down. But any surprise on inflation (say, an oil price jump or tariff-driven cost increases) could delay cuts and even put hikes back on the table. We’re prepared for either scenario. In our bond holdings, we’ve kept durations short-to-medium to limit interest rate sensitivity. We’re also ready to pivot – if the Fed signals an earlier easing (rate cuts), we may extend duration a bit to lock in higher yields; if inflation rears up, we might trim bonds and add to inflation-protected securities or commodities. On the credit side, we expect new issuance to pick up as companies that sat tight during the rate spike now feel more confident to borrow for expansion or acquisitions. That’s good for our private credit strategy – more deal flow at attractive terms. “Renting float” will remain a theme: by selling put options on quality names we’d love to own at lower prices, we earn premium (upfront cash) that serves as synthetic yield. It’s like being the house in a casino – we take in chips today for the promise to possibly buy stock lower later. If the market stays above our strike, we keep the cash (rent earned); if the stock falls to our strike, we buy a great company at a bargain (we’re happy to own it, as we pre-selected only companies we believe in). This strategy turns volatility and fear into an income stream – textbook Hushh approach 🤫. As rates stabilize, we’re also exploring selectively using modest leverage or “renting” cheap capital in the portfolio to enhance returns, but only when we have high conviction and ample safety margin. (Rest assured, any leverage is kept very conservative – we’re not into high-octane bets with your capital.)</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Alternatives & Private Markets – Sourcing Alpha Beyond the Obvious: Elevated public valuations mean alpha (excess return) must increasingly be found off the beaten path. In Q2, we expect to lean further into our network for alternative deals. We’re in late-stage due diligence for a couple of private investments: one in the data infrastructure space (think data centers or fiber networks benefiting from the AI boom) and one in a special situations credit strategy to capitalize on dislocations in the commercial real estate debt market. Our private equity outlook is that the middle-market momentum will continue – many founders who held off selling their businesses during the pandemic and 2022’s turmoil are coming to market now, providing deal opportunities at reasonable multiples. We’ll selectively co-invest alongside PE partners where we see Buffett-like businesses (strong moats, high returns on capital) that just happen to be private. Private credit remains very attractive; however, we are tightening covenants and due diligence given the late-cycle feel. In Q2, we expect to see more “lender-friendly” deals as borrowers accept higher costs of capital. This is a lender’s market, and we can demand strong protections. Real assets (infrastructure, real estate) will be a focus as well – with inflation uncertainty, owning assets with intrinsic value and cash yield (like toll roads or cell towers) is appealing. We anticipate some distressed opportunities may emerge if the economy softens – for example, if a highly leveraged company hits a refinancing wall, private credit funds (like us) could step in with rescue financing at very favorable terms. Having dry powder ready for such moments is key. Bottom line: Q2 likely offers a window to plant seeds in alternative assets that can sprout uncorrelated returns down the road.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Digital Assets & Tech Innovation – Cautious Engagement: Crypto’s Q1 slide was a sobering reminder of its volatility. For Q2, our approach in digital assets is cautious accumulation and active management. We expect the crypto market to search for a bottom and a new narrative. It could materialize if regulatory clarity improves (watch for any follow-up on the administration’s pro-crypto overtures) or if risk appetite returns broadly. We are particularly interested in the infrastructure layer of blockchain – the “picks and shovels” like smart contract platforms, scaling solutions, and data oracles that are not as hyped as meme coins but form the backbone of the ecosystem. In addition, we keep an eye on the convergence of AI and blockchain (as an AI-focused fund, we’re intrigued by projects at the intersection, such as using blockchain for data integrity in AI – ensuring AI decisions are audited and trustworthy). That said, we won’t be heroes in crypto; our positions remain small, and we use options where possible to hedge downside. If anything, the Q1 downturn lets us implement our “buy low” ethos here – similar to equities, we prefer accumulating when others are fearful, within reason. We anticipate Q2 could bring stabilization in Bitcoin around key technical levels, and possibly a divergence where the strongest projects start to outperform the weaker ones (a healthy consolidation). We’ll report back on any significant adjustments, but expect our crypto stance to remain a modest, opportunistic allocation.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Macro – Navigating the Cross-currents: The macro wildcard for Q2 is how policy and growth data evolve. We’ll be getting fresh reads on inflation, jobs, and possibly hints of fiscal policy moves. Notably, if the U.S. government pursues stimulative fiscal measures (the administration has talked about infrastructure spending and tax adjustments), that could boost growth but also add to deficit and inflation worries – a double-edged sword. Meanwhile, the tariff situation bears close watching: if trade negotiations make progress, markets could rally on reduced uncertainty; if instead we get an escalation (tariffs on more goods or higher rates), we might see another risk-off wave. We don’t try to predict politics, but we do scenario plan. For example, we’ve considered what sectors would be winners or losers if tariffs intensify (U.S. domestic-focused firms might gain an edge over import-reliant ones, etc.), and vice versa if tariffs are rolled back. Our cash positioning is slightly higher than usual going into Q2, giving us optionality. If a correction hits, we have cash to deploy; if markets grind up, we can selectively invest the cash in short-term instruments to earn yield until better opportunities arise. Essentially, we’re keeping some powder dry. We also continue to hedge certain macro exposures: a modest gold position for geopolitical/inflation shocks, some index put options as insurance against a sharp equity selloff, and currency hedges where appropriate (as an example, we hedged part of our Euro exposure given potential USD strength if global investors flock to U.S. assets during uncertainty).</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        In summary, our Q2 outlook is that of a surfer scanning the horizon for the next set of waves – we see some promising swells (opportunities in specific stocks and alternative assets), but also recognize the rip currents (macro risks) that require skillful navigation. We will stay true to our discipline: value, long-term growth, and risk management. If Q1 was about withstanding the test, Q2 is about playing offense smartly while still minding the defense. Now, let’s discuss how Fund A’s strategy is uniquely positioned to do just that.

        Fund A Strategy in Action: Aloha & Alpha – “Selling the Wall” and Renting the Float
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        It’s often said that strategy is what you don’t do as much as what you do. In Q1, we didn’t chase hype, we didn’t panic sell on pullbacks, and we didn’t stray from our core approach. What we did do was stick to our knitting – a strategy that blends classic Buffett-style investing with modern quantitative techniques and option overlays. I like to say we run an “income and aloha and alpha fund,” not a traditional hedge fund. In plain terms, that means we strive for both predictable income (aloha spirit – steady, relaxing vibes) and market-beating returns (alpha generation), by “blending data-driven strategies, advanced option overlays, and free-cash-flow-rich equities.”
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        <ListItem>Selling Puts and Calls (Options Overlay): This is our bread-and-butter for generating what we dub “aloha income” – consistent cash flow to our fund. By selling options, we essentially act like an insurance company for the market. In Q1, volatility spiked at times, which meant option premiums were rich. We took advantage by selling put options on companies we love but felt were over-punished during sell-offs. This earned us immediate income and, in a few cases, let us buy into those stocks at an even lower effective price when the puts were assigned. We also sold covered calls on some positions that had run up sharply early in the quarter. For example, when a couple of our AI-related stocks jumped 20%+ in January, we sold calls above the market (“selling the wall” at what we viewed as a wall of strong technical resistance). This strategy “rents the upside” – if the stock keeps soaring past our strike, we’ll trim our position by letting those shares get called away (sold at the strike, locking in gains); if the stock stalls below the strike (as it did when the AI rally cooled), we just pocket the call premium as extra income. Our “Sell the Wall” program (as we internally call it) has been a reliable alpha source: it’s a systematic way to harvest gains from exuberant rallies while still maintaining core exposure. In Q1, this approach added a few percentage points to our returns, cushioning the blows from the equity market drawdown. We will continue surfing that wave in Q2 – scaling up option selling when volatility spikes (e.g., around major Fed meetings or if trade headlines cause market jitters). We always do this thoughtfully, balancing the income earned against the risk of being too exposed if the market moves dramatically. Thus far, our risk underwriting on options has been solid – we structure these trades so that if we do end up long stock from puts or lose stock from calls, it aligns with our broader portfolio goals.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Maximizing “Aloha Income”: Beyond options, we generate aloha income through dividends, interest, and yield plays. In Q1, we rotated a portion of the portfolio into high dividend-yield stocks in sectors like utilities and telecom when their prices dipped. The result: we locked in yields of 4-5% on those names, providing steady quarterly cash flow. We also continued our involvement in a niche strategy akin to “renting float” – we participated in a reinsurance sidecar that provides catastrophe coverage (essentially collecting insurance premiums that we get to hold/invest, unless claims occur). This is a page from Buffett’s playbook (using insurance float to invest) albeit on a much smaller scale. That position generated income for us with very low correlation to markets. Additionally, our private credit allocations, as mentioned, are throwing off mid-to-high single digit yields. All told, Fund A produced a healthy income yield this quarter, which we either paid out to the partnership or, in the case of the fund’s accrual, reinvested into new opportunities. This income focus is not about chasing yield for yield’s sake – it’s about having a baseline return that doesn’t depend on market appreciation. It’s the cushion that lets us sleep at night and ride out storms. When you have cash coming in regularly, you’re less tempted to time the market or panic sell. We think of it as the “aloha state of mind” in investing – keep it chill, let the cash flow come to you.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Buying Free Cash Flow Kings/Queens/Aces: These are the core equity holdings of the fund – companies with robust free cash flow, excellent management, and reinvestment discipline. In Q1, this part of the portfolio was our rock. Even as the indexes seesawed, many of our core holdings delivered solid earnings and free cash flow growth, enabling some to even increase dividends or share buybacks. A few examples (without naming names due to compliance): one of our “free cash flow kings”, a leading enterprise software company, produced record free cash flow and announced a big share repurchase – the stock rose 8% on the quarter, defying the tech pullback. One of our “queens” – a mid-cap consumer staples firm – kept churning out cash, and while its stock was flat, it paid us a nice dividend and we think it’s poised for future appreciation. We did cash out of one longtime holding that hit our valuation target – in Buffett terms, we hate to bid adieu to a wonderful business, but when Mr. Market offers an absurd price, we won’t say no. In its place, we initiated a position in what we’d call a “free cash flow ace” – a smaller company with ace-high potential, i.e., strong cash flows and an underappreciated growth angle. We expect this company to graduate to king/queen status over time. The common thread in our equity picks is long-term free cash flow growth. This is the north star that guides our stock selection. We firmly believe that over time, stock prices follow free cash flow – maybe not every quarter, but inevitably. By focusing on businesses that can compound their cash flows year after year (and are judicious in reinvesting those flows into high-return projects or returning capital to shareholders), we set the fund up for multi-year compounding. It’s not always flashy – free cash flow kings can be the tortoises in a market full of hares – but as Q1 showed, when the hares slow down, the tortoise is still steadily moving forward.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>AI + Human “Intelligent Agent” Investing: A unique aspect of Hushh (and Fund A) is how we integrate AI into our investment process. I want to give you a peek under the hood. We have developed in-house AI models that sift through vast amounts of data – earnings transcripts, economic reports, satellite imagery (for things like tracking retail parking lot traffic or oil inventory), and even social media sentiment. These models act as our tireless analysts that work 24/7. However, unlike a fully systematic fund, we don’t blindly follow the AI. Instead, the AI is like an intelligent agent that augments our human team’s capabilities. It flags patterns or anomalies that a human might miss – for instance, it might alert us that a usually boring company had an unusual spike in online mentions, prompting us to investigate if something is brewing. Or it might crunch millions of option trades to tell us where there might be an opportunity to sell overpriced volatility. Our human analysts and portfolio managers then use judgment to interpret and decide. This synergy paid dividends in Q1. A concrete example: our AI trend analysis noticed very early that mentions of “tariffs” in earnings calls were spiking after the election – a hint that trade policy might turn hawkish. This contributed to our decision to trim some Asia-exposed cyclical stocks in January (protecting us from some losses when tariffs became front-page news in March). This is how we stay aligned with the evolving AI + human paradigm – using tech to enhance, not replace, our human decision-making. Moreover, we invest in companies that do the same. We love businesses that are “AI-augmented” rather than “AI-replaced”. An example in our portfolio is a financial services company using AI to assist its human advisors rather than automate them away – this way, the advisors become super-human in their productivity, and the company can scale without losing the human touch. We think this balanced approach will win in the marketplace, and likewise in investing. Rest assured, we are continuously upgrading our AI tools (our team is actually working on a next-gen model dubbed “Project AlohaBrain” to further improve our option strategy signals). But no matter how fancy, these tools remain under the oversight of our experienced team – the judgment, intuition, and yes, the occasional gut feeling of our human experts remains irreplaceable. Or as I like to quip, “AI is my co-pilot, not the autopilot.”</ListItem>

        Performance Highlights: Q1 2025 Scorecard (and a Humble Thank You to Mr. Market)
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Now for the part you’ve been waiting for – how did Fund A actually perform in Q1 2025? We’re pleased to report that the fund had a successful quarter, both on an absolute and relative basis. While we are constrained from sharing precise numbers in this letter (compliance and all that fine print), I can qualitatively say that we delivered positive returns in Q1 and outpaced the major global equity indices by a comfortable margin. This came during a quarter when the S&P 500 fell 4% and many hedge funds actually posted losses. Our volatility was lower than the equity market’s, thanks to the income strategies and hedges we employed. In other words, we achieved the elusive combo of “better returns with lower risk” (at least for this quarter). Year-to-date, Fund A is tracking ahead of our internal targets, putting us in a strong position as we enter Q2.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        However, let me be the first to say: one quarter does not make a track record, and we take these results with a grain of salt. We attribute a chunk of our Q1 gains to timing and luck – yes, luck. The macro winds shifted favorably for us in some instances. For example, our decision late last year to tilt a bit more defensive lined up well with the Q1 risk-off environment. We could just as easily have seen the opposite (imagine the Fed had cut rates unexpectedly in Feb, sparking an even bigger tech rally – our defensiveness would have lagged). There were also sentiment turning points that worked in our favor: we had been gingerly trimming some winners right when exuberance was highest (late Jan), not because we’re market-timers, but because position sizes had grown large. It so happened that February brought a sentiment swing, and we had cash ready to deploy into March weakness. These kind of fortunate coincidences are gifts from the market gods, and we are grateful for them. We certainly don’t bank on them. So while we give a quiet high-five to the first quarter’s results, we do so with humility. As Buffett wisely advises, “Don’t confuse brains with a bull market.” We like to add, don’t even confuse brains with a flat market – sometimes staying afloat is victory enough!
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        I want to thank macro cycles for turning when they did – a bit of a tongue-in-cheek thank you. In truth, what we call cycles and sentiment are just the collective outcome of millions of humans (and machines) reacting to events. We’re part of that ecosystem, not separate from it. So our gratitude is really to the market at large for presenting opportunities and rewarding prudence this quarter. And of course, my deepest gratitude goes to you, our Limited Partners, for your trust and steady hand. Some of you called me during the rockier moments of Q1 just to check in – not because you were panicking, but to say “we’re in it for the long haul, don’t worry about us.” That meant a lot. It allowed us to stay the course and even go on the offensive when many others were forced to deleverage or sell.

        Risk Management & Capital Preservation: Our North Star
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        In volatile times, it’s natural to worry about risks. Let me reiterate our unwavering commitment to capital preservation and thoughtful risk underwriting. Every investment we make, whether a stock, bond, or alternative asset, undergoes rigorous risk analysis. We constantly ask: what’s the downside? How do we mitigate it? In Q1, this meant stress-testing our portfolio against various scenarios – recession, inflation spike, market crash, etc. We were prepared, for instance, that if the equity drawdown had worsened beyond a certain threshold, we had hedges and cash to deploy to stabilize the portfolio. We also avoid concentration risk: our top position is around 5% of the fund, and the portfolio is spread across different asset classes and strategies, which helped this quarter (our losses in one area were offset by gains in another). We use risk limits for our options strategies too – for example, we won’t sell puts in aggregate that expose more than a certain percentage of the portfolio to any single stock or sector.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        A key part of our risk management is scenario planning in advance. You might recall in our 2024 year-end letter, we talked about “imagine the unimaginable.” In Q1, a few things that were not broadly expected happened – e.g., tariffs coming back into play. Because we had contemplated that possibility, we weren’t caught flat-footed. We’re now doing the same for Q2 and beyond: imagining scenarios like what if inflation reignites? what if a major geopolitical event occurs? what if AI investment turns out to be a bubble? – and ensuring we have a game plan. We can’t predict, but we can prepare. It’s like how Hawaii (keeping with our aloha theme) prepares extensively for tsunamis that rarely come. It’s the preparation that allows calm when the waves arrive.

        One metaphor I use with the team is “surfacing the risks.” A diver needs to periodically surface to avoid getting the bends; similarly, we surface from our daily focus to look at the bigger risk picture regularly. By doing so, we avoid being so deep in the weeds that we miss an approaching storm. If Q1’s message was anything, it’s that the macro environment can change on a dime – so we remain vigilant. The best way to not lose money is to always respect what could go wrong even when everything seems to be going right.

        Navigating an Elevated Valuation Environment: Key Opportunities & Our Edge
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        You’ve likely heard us talk about how today’s markets, even after Q1, still sport elevated valuations by historical standards – whether it’s price-to-earnings ratios for stocks or cap rates for real estate. This environment can be challenging; the easy pickings of cheap assets are few and far between. However, Fund A is built to navigate exactly this kind of landscape. How? By extracting value in less obvious ways and leaning on our unique alpha strategies.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Firstly, in high valuation times, stock selection and timing become paramount. We can’t just buy “the market” and expect great returns – we need to be in the right names and at the right entry points. Our free cash flow kings/queens/aces approach naturally steers us towards companies that justify their valuations with real cash generation. But even a great company can be a bad investment if bought at too high a price. That’s where our patience and options come in. We often say, we either buy at our price or we get paid to wait. For example, a quality stock trading at $100 that we think is worth $90 or less – we won’t chase it. Instead, we might sell a put option with a strike at $90. If the stock falls to $90, we buy at what we deemed a good value (and the decline likely came with a volatility spike, meaning we got paid richly via the option premium). If it never falls, we simply earned the premium – paid for our patience. This is how we create our own “value buys” even when the market overall isn’t cheap. It’s a key opportunity for value extraction that many traditional funds can’t or don’t utilize, but it’s second nature to us.

      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Secondly, we find value by looking where others aren’t looking. Elevated valuations tend to be a problem in the popular areas – U.S. large caps, hot tech sectors, etc. But there are always unloved or underfollowed corners. One such area now is small-cap stocks. They significantly lagged in the past couple of years and trade at a discount to large caps. Within small caps, we are zeroing in on a subset that have strong balance sheets and cash flows – essentially, mispriced gems that have been ignored because they’re not in the index darlings. We initiated or added to a few of these in Q1 and will continue in Q2. Private markets, as discussed, are another area – middle-market PE valuations are much more reasonable, and we can capture that through funds or co-investments. Also, international markets: Japan (which long had low valuations) is stirring with corporate governance reforms and could unlock value; certain emerging markets are trading cheap due to short-term issues but have solid long-term trajectories (we have selectively increased exposure there, mindful of currency risks).
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Thirdly, even in an expensive market, innovation and change create value. We position ourselves to capitalize on transitions. For instance, the transition to a more AI-centric economy means legacy firms that adapt will thrive, those that don’t will wither – so there’s an opportunity to short or avoid the losers and buy the winners. We haven’t talked much about shorting, since Fund A primarily focuses on long investments and income, but we do occasionally use shorts to hedge or express a negative view on an overhyped area. In Q1 we had a small short position on a tech ETF as a hedge, which we covered during the dip for a profit. In a high-valuation world, having the ability to bet against obvious excess is important. It’s not a large part of our strategy (and shorting comes with its own risks), but it’s a tool we keep ready.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Our edge in navigating this environment comes down to flexibility and discipline. Traditional funds might be 100% long equities and just have to swallow the bitter pill of high prices, hoping earnings grow into them. We don’t have to play that game. We can adjust our asset mix – as we did by adding alternatives, by writing options, by raising some cash – to manufacture returns that don’t rely solely on market beta. In practical terms, this quarter we extracted a lot of our return from sources independent of market direction: option premiums (from selling the wall and surfing volatility), credit interest, and special situation gains. That’s alpha. And when we did take beta (market exposure), we tried to ensure it was tied to assets with a margin of safety (undervalued or high-quality ones).

      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        We’ll continue exploiting that edge by being nimble surfers on the wave of markets, rather than passive swimmers. Whether the wave is a towering bull or a crashing correction, we have the toolkit to handle it: sometimes you ride it, sometimes you get out of its way, sometimes you even ride against it in the undertow. It’s all about reading the currents.

        Closing Thoughts: Staying True to Our Principles
      </Heading>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        As we wrap up our Q1 letter, I want to bring it back to the big picture. We stand at an exciting juncture in finance – technology is transforming how markets operate, new asset classes (from crypto to carbon credits) are emerging, and the global economy is evolving under the influence of both AI advancements and shifting geopolitical tides. Amid all this change, the timeless principles of investing remain our anchor:
      </Text>
      <List spacing={3} mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        <ListItem>Focus on long-term value: We invest in businesses and strategies that we believe will stand the test of time and compound value. We’re not in it for quick flips; we’re in it to build enduring wealth alongside you.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Discipline and patience: In a TikTok world that prizes instant gratification, we’re perfectly happy being old-school in waiting for the right opportunity. As the saying goes, money is made in the waiting. Our activity in Q1 – selling this, buying that – all stems from plans laid well in advance and patience executed in real time.</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Integrity and alignment: I have a significant portion of my own net worth in Fund A, alongside yours. Our team eats our own cooking. Every decision is made with the knowledge that it affects our money just like it affects yours. This alignment keeps us honest and focused on capital preservation. We’ll never swing for the fences with your capital unless we’re willing to do the same with ours (and even then, we’d question if swinging for fences is wise – usually it isn’t).</ListItem>
        <ListItem>Continuous learning: The Buffett wisdom meets Gen-Z mindset means we combine age-old truths with new information constantly. We learn from each quarter, each success, each mistake. We encourage a culture at Hushh 🤫 where every team member, from the newest analyst to me, the founder, can voice insights or concerns. Q1 taught us a few lessons and reinforced others. We’ll carry those into Q2 and beyond.</ListItem>
      </List>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        To conclude, we feel confident yet vigilant as we move forward. Q1 2025 tested our strategy and it held up well. We expect Q2 and the rest of the year will bring its own tests – and we are ready to face them with the same blend of Buffett-style prudence and millennial-style open-mindedness. If the markets throw a curveball, we’ll adjust our stance, maybe even “rent the float” from that curveball’s momentum. If the bull comes charging back, we’ll ride it but not forget to take some profits and thank the cycle when appropriate. And through it all, we’ll keep communication with you transparent and frequent.
      </Text>
      <Text mb={4} fontSize={{ md: "lg", base: 'sm' }}>
        Thank you for your trust, and for the privilege of managing your capital. It’s not something we ever take lightly. As always, feel free to reach out with any questions or just to chat. In the spirit of aloha, our door (and inbox and phone line) is always open. Here’s to a prosperous Q2 and beyond, with controlled risk and abundant opportunities!
