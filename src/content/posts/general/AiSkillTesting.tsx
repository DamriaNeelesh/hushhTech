        We live in an age of miracles. But a pre-requisite for any company to harness these miracles is that employees should be excited - and proactive - about learning how to use them.

        To test this, Iâ€™d suggest a new 2-part interview question for every candidate, whether CFO or CSR (customer service rep):

        Iâ€™d suggest including this question (or even a session!) as part of every interview loop, to help identify candidates who will help your company succeed in this age of miracles. Candidates who do poorly in this question should not get an offer, even if they excel in other parts of the interview.
