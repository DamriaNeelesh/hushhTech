        Key Responsibilities
      </Heading>
      <VStack align="start" spacing={4}>
        <Box>
          <Text>
            • AI-Driven Trading Strategy: Design, implement, and refine algorithmic trading strategies powered by advanced AI (deep reinforcement learning, supervised learning, etc.). Your algorithms will autonomously execute trades across multiple asset classes, continuously learning and improving, while incorporating a human-in-the-loop for high-level guidance and risk oversight.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Human-in-the-Loop Oversight: Develop a framework for human oversight and intervention in the trading loop. Ensure our AI makes intelligent decisions but keeps humans in control at critical junctures, aligning with best practices that cite keeping a “human in the loop” as key to mitigating AI risks. You will build dashboards and controls for real-time human monitoring, and mechanisms for human traders to easily override or adjust AI strategies when needed.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Ultra-Low-Latency Infrastructure: Architect and optimize ultra-low-latency trading systems from the ground up. You’ll oversee everything from hardware choices (network cards, colocation, FPGA/ASIC acceleration) to software optimizations (lock-free programming, kernel bypass, etc.) to achieve execution speeds at the limits of physics. For certain strategies, even a few nanoseconds can make the difference in profitability – you will ensure our tick-to-trade pipeline is as fast as technologically possible.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Market Microstructure & Execution: Leverage your expert knowledge of market microstructure (order books, matching engines, order types, etc.) to give our trading strategies an edge. Design smart execution algorithms that minimize slippage and trading costs while capitalizing on microstructure inefficiencies. You’ll guide the team in fine-tuning how our AI submits and cancels orders, reacts to market data, and navigates multiple venues to capture opportunities that others miss.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Leadership & Collaboration: Build and lead a top-tier team of quantitative researchers and engineers. Foster a culture of excellence, innovation, and rigorous testing. You will mentor team members, set technical direction, and ensure effective collaboration between the AI research side and the trading operations side. As a senior leader, you’ll also work closely with our founders and advisors on overall company strategy, and interface with investors/partners as the technical visionary for our trading capabilities.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Risk Management and Performance Optimization: Implement robust risk controls within the trading algorithms (position limits, kill-switches, anomaly detection) to protect against unforeseen scenarios. Constantly evaluate performance of strategies using metrics like Sharpe, drawdowns, and latency benchmarks, and drive improvements. You’ll balance aggression with prudence – pushing the AI to be bold in seeking alpha, while always controlling for tail risks and aligning with the firm’s risk appetite.

            • Cutting-Edge AI Expertise: Deep experience with machine learning, particularly reinforcement learning in trading or complex decision-making systems. You understand state-of-the-art algorithms (DQN, PPO, actor-critic methods, etc.) and have possibly applied them to real trading or similar high-frequency decision environments. You believe in the power of AI – perhaps you even know that modern RL can, in many cases, make better trading decisions than humans – and you’re excited to prove it in live markets.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Quantitative Trading Acumen: A strong track record in quantitative trading, ideally in high-frequency or ultra-low-latency contexts. You deeply understand market microstructure and have built or traded strategies in equities, futures, FX, or crypto that require reacting in milliseconds or faster. Experience with strategy development (momentum, market making, stat arb, etc.) and a keen intuition for what makes a trading strategy successful are essential.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Systems & Infrastructure Mastery: Proven ability to design and optimize high-performance trading systems.

            • Education and Domain Credentials: An advanced degree (PhD or Masters) in a relevant field – e.g. Computer Science, Machine Learning, Mathematics, Financial Engineering – is a strong plus, but we care more about what you’ve done and your ability to apply knowledge creatively. Publications or competition wins in AI/ML (e.g. Kaggle, ACM competitions) or a track record of profitable trading strategies will make you stand out.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Passion for Innovation: This role is for someone who lives and breathes innovation. You stay on top of research papers, experiment with new ideas for fun, and are excited by “impossible” problems. You have a hacker mindset geared toward finding clever solutions, and you’re thrilled by the idea of creating something truly revolutionary. Importantly, you share our philosophy that combining AI automation with human insight can yield the best outcomes.

        In a world of quant roles at elite hedge funds and trading firms, hushhTech offers something unique. We’re a tech-driven investment startup founded by leaders from world-class tech companies and finance. (Our founder is an ex-Google product director who launched hushhTech to fuse AI with investing, and our chief scientist is a former Salesforce data scientist.) This means:

          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Startup Agility, Big Impact: You won’t be a small cog in a big machine. You’ll architect our quant programs from the ground up, owning both research and implementation. At top funds you might tweak one model; here you will build the whole engine.

          <Text>
            • Transparency and Trust: hushhTech is built on candor and openness – from how we debate ideas to how we share our business success. For example, we practice full salary transparency (see Compensation below) which big hedge funds rarely do. We believe confronting the facts and being open builds trust (a page straight out of Jim Collins’ playbook on going from good to great).

            • Drive Quant Strategy: Take ownership of our quantitative investment strategies end-to-end. You’ll research market inefficiencies, design trading models, and rigorously test strategies to consistently generate alpha (sustainable, repeatable returns). We expect you to apply first-principles thinking and creative modeling, not just reuse canned formulas.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Engineer Investment Programs: Architect and build the algorithms and systems that execute our investment strategies. You’ll lead development of our quantitative trading platform – writing code, choosing the right technologies, and ensuring that our models go from whiteboard to live trading seamlessly. (In short, you’ll be the engineer of our “investment engine.”)

        Role Overview: hushhTech.com is a fast-growing systematic trading firm on a mission to maximize both alpha (excess returns) and aloha (a spirit of collaboration and humility) through cutting-edge automation. As the Head of Quants and Investment Programs Engineer, you will be the architect of our AI-driven trading strategies – spearheading the scale-up and innovation of our proprietary “Sell the Wall” program. (A sell wall refers to a massive cluster of sell orders at a given price level that can heavily influence market pricing.) This role is central to hushhTech’s success, driving our transition from successful small-scale tactics into high-performance, automated trading systems that amplify both profitability and consistency. You will work closely with the founder to transform proven trading insights into robust algorithms, directly impacting our trading performance and competitive edge in the market.

        Key Responsibilities:
      </Heading>
      <VStack align="start" spacing={4}>
        <Box>
          <Text>
            • Algorithmic Strategy Design: Design, develop, and continually refine automated trading systems to execute the “Sell the Wall” strategy across different time horizons. This includes encoding our strategic wall-selling tactics into algorithms that operate from high-frequency scalps to longer-term positional trades.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • AI-Enhanced Execution: Leverage AI/ML models to improve signal generation and execution quality. Integrate predictive models that optimize order placement and timing (reducing slippage and improving fill rates) by learning market patterns. The goal is to enhance trade efficiency and adaptiveness – smarter algorithms for better alpha.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • New Product & Program Development: Innovate new quantitative trading programs that extract alpha in novel ways. For example, develop supplemental strategies (e.g. market-making, statistical arbitrage, options-based hedging) that complement “Sell the Wall.” Build tools to analyze order book dynamics and identify opportunities where liquidity walls can be exploited for profit.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Ultra-Low Latency Engineering: Ensure our trading infrastructure operates at minimal latency for competitive execution. Optimize code (e.g. in C++/Rust), networks, and hardware for speed – in high-frequency trading, “every microsecond counts”. You will oversee latency tuning and micro-optimizations so that our systems can compete in the HFT arena, where being milliseconds ahead means capturing opportunities others miss.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Execution & Infrastructure Optimization: Architect a high-performance trading engine that can handle large volumes of orders and market data in real time. Implement efficient order routing and execution algorithms that maximize our fill success while minimizing market impact. Introduce robust monitoring and fail-safes to ensure reliability even in volatile market conditions.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Real-Time Risk Management: Develop systematic methods for real-time risk monitoring and portfolio adjustment. Your programs should dynamically manage position sizes, inventory from market-making, and stop-loss levels based on market conditions and strategy rules. Ensure that as we trade aggressively, we are also continuously aware of exposure and can react instantly to market movements or model deviations.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Performance Analytics & Iteration: Establish analytics to measure strategy performance (P&L, win-rate, drawdowns, execution slippage) and use these insights to iterate on and improve the algorithms. Continuously tune parameters and models to adapt to changing market microstructure or regimes, ensuring our edge is sustained.

        Qualifications:
      </Heading>
      <VStack align="start" spacing={4}>
        <Box>
          <Text>
            • Experience: 8+ years in quantitative finance, algorithmic trading, or high-frequency trading. Proven track record at a top-tier trading firm, hedge fund, or algo trading desk where you built or significantly scaled trading systems.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Programming Expertise: Mastery of low-level, high-performance programming (such as C++, Rust) and scripting for data science (Python). Ability to write highly optimized, memory-safe code for latency-critical components, as well as rapid prototyping of models/analytics. Familiarity with parallel computing, real-time data processing, and efficient algorithms is expected.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Quantitative Skills: Strong foundation in applied mathematics and statistics. Deep understanding of AI/ML modeling techniques (e.g. time-series forecasting, reinforcement learning for trade execution, deep learning) to generate and refine trading signals. Able to develop and validate predictive models under real-world market conditions (noisy, non-stationary data).
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Trading & Market Knowledge: Deep understanding of market microstructure (exchange order books, order types, liquidity dynamics) and how to capitalize on it. Experience with options pricing and Greeks, and familiarity with derivatives strategies is a big plus – you should be comfortable valuing complex instruments and using options to hedge or leverage positions. Knowledge across asset classes (equities, futures, options; and even crypto markets) and how they differ in behavior and infrastructure.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • System Scaling: Demonstrated experience in scaling up trading infrastructure – from accelerating execution speeds to handling more markets/instruments. You have tuned systems for performance (e.g., brought down latency, increased throughput) and perhaps handled migrations from prototype to production. Experience with cloud and on-premise hybrid setups, co-location/proximity hosting, and using advanced tooling for latency measurement is valuable.
          </Text>

            • Entrepreneurial & Ownership Mindset: You thrive in a startup-like environment, taking initiative and ownership. You’re eager to wear multiple hats and do whatever it takes to drive trading success, without needing a large team or extensive resources.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Alpha Passion with Aloha Spirit: An intense passion for alpha generation – you love the thrill of finding an edge in the markets – balanced with an “aloha” spirit. This means you approach trading with aggression and confidence, but approach teamwork and execution with humility and respect. We value a positive attitude and the ability to stay calm and grounded even amid high-pressure trading scenarios.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Data-Driven & Analytical: You trust data over gut feeling. You constantly seek out new information and rigorously test ideas. Decisions here are driven by empirical evidence and rigorous analysis, not ego.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Automation & Efficiency Obsession: You have an automation-first mindset – if something can be coded or systematically improved, you will do it. Repetitive manual tasks bother you, and you find ways to streamline workflows for yourself and the team, making our operations lean and efficient.
          </Text>
          <Text>
            • Leadership & Collaboration: While this is a hands-on role, it is also a leadership position. You should be able to lead by example – writing code, analyzing trades, and also mentoring others as the team grows. Strong communication skills are key for collaborating with the founder and any future team members. You’re a team player who can also rally others around an idea or strategy.
